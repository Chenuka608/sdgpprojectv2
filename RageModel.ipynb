[10] 1.You pay what you use: While using cloudcomputing services, you only pay for the servicesyou use, which makes it more cost-efficient 2.Flexibility: As your business progresses the scaleof the data to be handled increase or decreasescloud services provide to change your cloudcapacity at anytime. 3.Backups/data recovery: For small scale businessesit is difficult to set up a data recovery systems butcloud computing provides data recovery optionwhich avoids a substantial investment. 4.Mobile Connect: One of the essential features ofcloud computing is you can work from anywhere. 5.Security: When it comes to data, security alwayscomes under consideration as every user wantstheir data to be secure.

There is no necessity to install thesoftware in the userÕs system as the cloud provideseverything. As the software is not running on theuserÕs system there is no need to invest in hardwarereducing the cost. 2.Platform as a service (PaaS): Here the user has controlover applications and configuration settings for theapplication environment including network, servers,OS and storage. 3.Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): IaaS refers to anonline service which provides high-level API. It alsooffers containerization which gives higherperformance than virtualization as there is no hypervisor involved in it. The capacity of containers auto-scales dynamically making you pay only for what youuse. It also provides additional resources likefirewalls, object storage, IP addresses, VLANs etc.\n",
